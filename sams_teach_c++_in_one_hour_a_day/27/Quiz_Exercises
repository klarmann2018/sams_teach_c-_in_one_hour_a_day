Quiz

1. You need to only write to a file. What stream would you use?

- ofstream

ans:
    Use ofstream to only write to a file.

2. How would you use cin to get a complete line from the input stream?

- getline(cin, strData); 

ans:
    You would use cin.getline(). See Listing 27.7.

3. You need to write std::string objects to a file. Would you choose
   ios_base::binary mode?

- yes

ans:
    You wouldn't because std::string contains text information and you can stay
    with the default mode, which is text(no need for binary).

4. You opened a stream using open(). Why bother using is_open()?

- if(is_open())  to find the file exist or not!
    
ans:
    To check if open() succeeded.

Exercises

1. BUG BUSTER: Find the error in the following code:

    fstream myFile;
    myFile.open("HelloFile.tex", ios_base::out);
    myFile<<"Hello file!";
    myFile.close();

-
    if(myFile.is_open())
    {
        myFile....
        myFile.close();
    }

ans:
    You opened the file but didn't check for success of open() using is_open() before using the stream or closing it.

2. BUG BUSTER: Find the error in the following code:

    ifstream MyFile("SomeFile.txt");
    if(MyFile.is_open())
    {
        MyFile << "This is some text" << endl;
        MyFile.close();
    }

-
    ifstream MyFile("", ios_base::in);

ans:
    You cannot insert into an ifstream, which is designed for input, not output,
    and hence does not support stream insertion operator<<.
