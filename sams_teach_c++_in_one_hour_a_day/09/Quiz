1. When I create an instance of a class using new, where is the class created?
-   heap, 在堆栈。
--  On the free store. This is the same as it would be if you allocated for an
int using new.

2. My class has a raw point int* that contains a dynamically allocated array of
   integers. Does sizeof report different sizes depending on the number of
   integers in the dynamic array?
- no, sizeof is integer size. 还是整数尺寸。 
-- sizeof() calculates the size of a class on the basis of the declared data
members. As the sizeof(pointer) is constant and independent of the mass of data
being pointed to, the sizeof(Class) containg one such pointer member remains
constant as well.

3. All my class members are private, and my class does not contain any declared
   friend class or function. Who can access these members?
- 类自己的方法可以 get set
-- None except member methods of the same class.

4. Can one class member method invoke another?
- 可以
-- Yes, it can.

5. What is constructor good for?
-
-- A constructor is typically used to initialize data members and resources.

6. What is a destructor good for?
- 析构函数 的作用 是 释放内存空间
-- Destructors are typically used for releasing resources and deallocating memory.
