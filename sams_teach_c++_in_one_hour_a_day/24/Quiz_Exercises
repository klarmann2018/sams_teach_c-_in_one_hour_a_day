Quiz

1. Can you change the behavior of the priority_queue for a certain element, such
   that the one with the greatest value is popped last?

- i can. use: pq.top()

ans:
    Yes, by supplying a predicate.

2. You have a priority_queue of class Coins. What member operator do you need to
   define for the priority_queue class to present the coin with the greater
   value at the top position?

- priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int>>

ans:
    class Coins needs to implement operator<.

3. You have a stack of class CCoins and have pushed six objects into it. Can you
   access or delete the first coin inserted?

- no.

ans:
    No, you can only work on the top of the stack. So you can't access the coin
    at the bottom.

Exercises

1. A queue of people(class CPerson) are lining up at the post office. CPerson
   contains member attributes that hold age and gender and are defined as

   class Person
   {
        public:
            int Age;
            bool IsFemale;
    };

Write a binary predicate for the priority_queue that helps service oder people
and woman(in that order) on a priority.

- priority_queue<Person, vector<Person>, Predicate<Person>()>
template<typename T>
struct Predicate
{
    bool operator()(const T& t1, const T& t2) const
    {

        return(t1.age>t2.age);
    }

};

ans:
    The binary predicate could be operator<:
    class Person
    {
        public:
            int Age;
            bool IsFemale;

            bool operator< (const Person& anotherPerson) const
            {
                bool bRet = false;
                if(Age > anotherPerson.Age)
                    bRet=true;
                else if (IsFemale && anotherPerson.IsFemale)
                    bRet =true;

                return bRet;
            }
    }

2. Write a program that reverses the user's string input using the stack class.

- see ex24_02.cpp

ans:
    Just insert into the stack. As you pop data, you effectively reverse
    contents because a stack is a LIFO type of a container.
