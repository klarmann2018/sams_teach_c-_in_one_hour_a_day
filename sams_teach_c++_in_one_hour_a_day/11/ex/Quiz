1. You are modeling shapes -- circle and triangle -- and what every shape to compulsorily implement functions Area() and Print(). How would you do it?
class shape()
{
        public: 
            virtual area()=0;
            virtual print()=0;
    }

class circle : public shape
{

}

class triangle : public shape
{

}

2. Does a compiler create a Virtual Fuction Table for all classes?
no
It creates a VFT only for those classes that contain virtual functions; this includes derived classes, too.

3. My class Fish has two public methods, one pure virtual function, and some member attributes. Is it still an abstract base class?
yes, it is.
it still cannot be instantiated. As long as a class has at least one pure
virtual function, it remains an ABC irrespective of the presence or absence of
other fully defined functions or parameters.
