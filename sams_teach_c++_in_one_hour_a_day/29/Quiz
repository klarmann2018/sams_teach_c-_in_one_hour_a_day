1. My image processing application doesn't respond when it is correcting the
   contrast. What should I do?

- 
    change the program, optimal the running.

ans:
    It seems that your application does all the activity within one thread. So,
    if the image processing itself(contrast correction) is processor intensive,
    the UI is unresponsive. You ought to split these two activities into two
    threads so that the OS switches the two threads, giving processor time
    to both the UI and the worker that does the correction.

2. My multithreaded application allows for extremely fast access to the
   database. Yet, sometimes I see that the data fetched is garbled. What am I
   doing wrong?

- 
  use multithread program. simphore

ans:
    Your threads are possibly poorly synchronized. You are writing to and
    reading from an object at the same time, resulting in inconsistent or
    garbled data recovery. Insert a binary semaphore and ensure that the table
    cannot be accessed when it is being modified.
