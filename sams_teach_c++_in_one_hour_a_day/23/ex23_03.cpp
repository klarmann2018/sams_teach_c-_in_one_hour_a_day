 *    Description:  You are writing an application that records the characteristics of stars that
   come up on the horizon in the order in which they rise. In astronomy, the
   size of the star --- as well as information on their relative rise and set
   sequences --- is important. If you're sorting this collection of stars on the
   basis of their sizes, would you use std::sort or std::stable_sort?
